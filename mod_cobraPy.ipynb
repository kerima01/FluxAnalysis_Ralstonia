    "Dans le premier cas, seules les réactions NGAME (consommation minimale d’ATP pour la maintenance) et FEOXpp (production d’ATP désactivée) sont fixées, sans apport de nutriments carbonés. Le modèle prédit un taux de croissance nul, car la cellule ne dispose pas des sources de carbone et des précurseurs nécessaires pour produire de la biomasse, malgré la consommation d’ATP et les échanges d’ions inorganiques pour la maintenance. Dans le deuxième cas, les flux des réactions de transport des principaux nutriments expérimentaux (glucose, acides aminés, EPS, etc.) sont fixés aux valeurs mesurées. Cela permet au modèle de simuler l’apport en carbone et précurseurs indispensables à la biosynthèse, ce qui conduit à une croissance positive (taux de croissance = 0,512). Ainsi, la comparaison des deux cas montre que la disponibilité des nutriments externes est déterminante pour permettre la croissance cellulaire dans le modèle, alors que l’ATP seul ne suffit que pour la maintenance."
